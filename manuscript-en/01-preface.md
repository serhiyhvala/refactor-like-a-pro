# Preface

The idea for this book appeared after my talk ‚ÄúRefactoring Like a Superhero,‚Äù[^talk] which I was making in January 2022. For that talk, I've collected various technics and heuristics of refactoring I wanted to share.

At some point, it became apparent that I couldn't fit everything I wanted to discuss into a 40-minute slot. I had to cut and trim the material for the talk to show the most valuable practices and technics.

The cut-out material wasn't useless, though. It contained details and clarifications about the technics' usage and applicability. I decided it would make more sense not to throw out everything that didn't fit but to change the format and release it as an online book. That's how this project came to be.

## Who Might Want to Read This Book

This book might be helpful for developers of web services and user applications who write in high-level languages and have a couple of years of experience.

Library developers might also find some ideas, but I'll mainly focus on user applications since I have more experience in that area.

This book doesn't consider the needs and constraints of low-level development. Some heuristics in it might contradict best practices of low-level code. If you write ‚Äúcloser to the hardware,‚Äù please, be careful, and proceed at your own risk üòÉ

## What This Book Is Not

I don't claim to show ‚Äúthe only correct way‚Äù to refactor and write code in this book. If you have a lot of experience, you probably already know most of the techniques described and have your own opinion.

Also, this is not a ‚Äústep-by-step manual‚Äù universally applicable to all projects. My development experience biases my coding habits and programming style. Your experience, projects, and habits may differ from mine, so our views may not be the same. That's okay.

The purpose of this book is to describe a set of practices and heuristics that helped _me_ start writing code that _looks good_ to me and the people I worked with.

Not all practices have to be applied at all times. Using an idea depends significantly on the project, the context, available resources, and the purpose of refactoring. Try to choose techniques that bring more benefits at less cost.

If something in the book seems helpful to you, discuss it with your colleagues and other developers. Make sure you and your team have the same opinion about the chosen idea's benefits and costs. Don't apply something controversial to your team.

## Limitations and Applicability

All of the techniques described here are a compilation of the books I've read and my experience in development. I have spent most of my time developing medium and sometimes large user applications.

My experience imprints on the way I see good code. Basically, the whole book is a snapshot of my perception of development in 2022. My opinion may have changed if you're reading this in the future.

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I will update the book's text as my opinion changes, but I can't guarantee I will do so promptly and without delay. |

As you read the book, be aware of the author's cognitive biases. Weigh the techniques before using them and consider their applicability to your project.

## Good to Know Before Reading

In the text, I assume you're already familiar with the concept of refactoring[^term] and that you have a couple of years of programming experience. I expect you've already encountered issues with task decomposition, ‚Äúleaky‚Äù abstractions, separation of concerns between modules, etc.

I expect you've heard about some of the ‚Äúprogramming buzzwords‚Äù on this list:

- Separation of concerns
- Coupling and cohesion
- Declarative style
- Abstraction layers
- Command-query separation
- Referential transparency
- Functional pipeline
- Functional core in an imperative shell
- Layered architecture, ‚ÄúPorts and Adapters‚Äù
- Direction of dependencies
- Immutability and statelessness
- 12-factor applications

You don't have to _know_ them. We'll be exploring the terms and techniques as the book progresses. But it's good if you have a rough idea about their basic meaning.

## Why Another Book

There are many books on refactoring, why do we need another one?

By and large, we don't. All the principles and techniques are described in other books, most likely in a much more detailed, logical, and correct way.

I need this text, first of all, for myself:

- To systematize what I know today;
- To refer to a specific topic when discussing a problem;
- To mark the level of my knowledge so that I understand where to improve and what to learn.

However, I thought that maybe this text could be helpful to someone else, so here we are. I hope you'll find this book helpful!
