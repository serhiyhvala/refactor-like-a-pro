# Refactor Like a Superhero

It is a book about how to refactor code efficiently and without pain. In it, we'll discuss the benefits of refactoring for development and business, explore how to search for problems in your code, and investigate possible solutions for those problems.

We will use code examples primarily in JavaScript and sometimes in TypeScript. However, the technics we're going to discuss can be used in other high-level languages as well. So if you don't code in JS/TS but feel comfortable around them, you might find something that you can adopt to your language too.

If you like the book, give it a ⭐️ on GitHub and share the link with other developers who might want to read it!
